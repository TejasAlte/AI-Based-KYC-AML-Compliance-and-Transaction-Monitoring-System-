# AI-Based-KYC-AML-Compliance-and-Transaction-Monitoring-System-
This project involves creating an AI-powered KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) system, which includes a transaction monitoring tool to detect suspicious financial activities. The project will integrate AI and machine learning algorithms to flag high-risk customers and transactions in a simulated banking environment.

# Technologies:
- Financial Regulations: KYC, AML, and financial crime risk management.
- Risk Management: Assessing customer risk and flagging suspicious transactions.
- AI/ML: Basic implementation of machine learning for fraud detection.
- Data Handling & Reporting: SQL, Excel, VBA for data manipulation, analysis, and reporting.
- Communication: Presenting the findings through reports or a user interface.
